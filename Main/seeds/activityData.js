    "activity_description": "Hiking opportunities at Acadia are seemingly endless on more than 150 miles of trails. Immerse yourself in forests, walk along rocky coastlines, or stand on exposed mountain tops â€” sometimes all in one hike. Do not be fooled by the height of the park's mountains; challenging hikes climb from sea level to summits. If a leisurely stroll along the coast or around a lake is more your pace, there are plenty of easier, more level options. Many trails can also be combined with walks on the carriage roads and dirt fire roads.",
