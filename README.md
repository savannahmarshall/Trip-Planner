# Trip Planner

## Description
This Node.js and Express.js application functions as a trip planner. Users are greeted with a login page where they can create a new account by providing their email and choosing a password. Once registered, users can log in and access the homepage. Here, they can search for any National Park and view a list of activities available at that park. Users can save activities for trip planning and can remove activities from the saved list as needed. This application aims to simplify the often stressful task of trip planning.

### Key Learnings:
* **Interactive Full-Stack Application:** Refined skills in creating an interactive, full-stack web application using Node.js and Express.js.
* **Handlebars Utilization:** Leveraged the Handlebars JavaScript templating library to create reusable code.
* **Defined GET and POST Routes:** Implemented GET and POST routes to retrieve and add data.
* **Insomnia:** Utilized Insomnia to determine API endpoints.

### Challenges Faced:
* **Modularization** Managing modularization was challenging due to the large number of files.
* **Debugging** Debugging multiple components was necessary due to the complexity of the file structure and content.

By overcoming these challenges, we enhanced our collaboration skills and developed a polished, functional full-stack application.
